# WhiteLabel-MS-Nodejs

This is a micro-servce template for Node.js that uses the best serverless principles:

- Simplicity
- Modularity
- TDD
- Hexagonal Architecture

## Why?

When developig a serverless Architecture, you can use this infrastructure as Lambda Function, an AWS Fargate or a Lambda Container with
some or none modifications. This helps developing fast-paced and scalable applications.
